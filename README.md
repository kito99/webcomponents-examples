# webcomponents-v1-examples
Examples of using the Web Components V1 spec,  plus hello world examples for Polymer, Skate, and Stencil.


NOTE: Currently the Skate.js example uses native ES2015 modules and requires manually editing the skatejs/esnext imports to have an extension.
 It has only been tested in Chrome. I'll eventually add a build script for this.
